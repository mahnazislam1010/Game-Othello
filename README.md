### How to Play Othello 
In Othello, the two colours are Black and White and Black always plays first
In Othello, the four squares in the middle of the board start with four counters already placed - white top left and bottom right; black top right and bottom left.
In Othello, a player without a move simply passes, and the other player keeps playing pieces until the first player can make a move again.
According to World championship rules typically give each player a total of 30 minutes to make all of their moves. This time is reduced after each turn until a player runs out of time or the game is over.
